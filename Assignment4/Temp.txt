Ganesh Chaturthi is a vibrant 10-day festival in Maharashtra, celebrating the birth of Lord Ganesha, the remover of obstacles and god of wisdom. Popularized as a public event by Lokmanya Tilak in 1893 to foster unity against British rule, it now features grand, eco-friendly community pandals, artistic clay idols, and heartfelt, festive processions. 
Historical and Cultural Significance
While celebrated nationwide, Ganesh Chaturthi holds unparalleled importance in Maharashtra, particularly in Pune and Mumbai. 
It was transformed from a private household ritual into a public celebration (Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav) by freedom fighter Lokmanya Tilak in 1893 to unite people across different social backgrounds during the colonial era. 
Today, it serves as a massive, 10-day, community-driven event, promoting social harmony, cultural performances, and devotion
Celebrations and Rituals
The festival begins in the Hindu month of Bhadrapada (August-September). 
Installation: Households and public pandals install clay idols of Lord Ganesha, often beautifully decorated.
Rituals: Daily aartis and bhajans are performed, with offerings of modaks and laddus.
Vibrancy: Streets are filled with music, dance, and festive energy, particularly during the 1.5, 5, 7, or 10th-day processions.
Visarjan (Immersion): On Anant Chaturdashi, the idols are carried to the sea or local water bodies for immersion, marking a farewell to Ganesha with the chant "Ganpati Bappa Morya, Pudhchya Varshi Lavkar Ya".
