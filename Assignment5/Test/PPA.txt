Ganesh Chaturthi is a vibrant 10-day festival in Maharashtra, celebrating the birth of Lord Ganesha, the remover of obstacles and god of wisdom. Popularized as a public event by Lokmanya Tilak in 1893 to foster unity against British rule, it now features grand, eco-friendly community pandals, artistic clay idols, and heartfelt, festive processions. 
Historical and Cultural Significance
While celebrated nationwide, Ganesh Chaturthi holds unparalleled importance in Maharashtra, particularly in Pune and Mumbai. 
It was transformed from a private household ritual into a public celebration (Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav) by freedom fighter Lokmanya Tilak in 1893 to unite people across different social backgrounds during the colonial era. 
Today, it serves as a massive, 10-day, community-driven event, promoting social harmony, cultural performances, and devotion
